            "content": "**Q1: What is the Virtual DOM?**\nAnswer: An in-memory representation of the Real DOM. React uses it to diff changes and update the UI efficiently without reloading the whole page.\n\n**Q2: Explain JSX.**\nAnswer: An HTML-like syntax used in React to describe UI components. It compiles to regular JavaScript objects.\n\n**Q3: What is a Component?**\nAnswer: An independent, reusable piece of code that defines a part of the user interface.\n\n**Q4: Functional vs Class Components?**\nAnswer: Functional components are simpler, use Hooks, and are the modern standard. Class components are legacy and use lifecycle methods.\n\n**Q5: What are Props?**\nAnswer: Read-only inputs passed from a parent to a child to transfer data.\n\n**Q6: What is State?**\nAnswer: Internal data managed by a component that can change over time and triggers re-renders.\n\n**Q7: Difference between State and Props?**\nAnswer: Props are passed in (external), while State is self-contained (internal).\n\n**Q8: What is Prop Drilling?**\nAnswer: Passing props through middle components that don't need them just to reach a distant child.\n\n**Q9: How to avoid Prop Drilling?**\nAnswer: Use Context API or state management like Redux/Zustand.\n\n**Q10: What is create-react-app?**\nAnswer: A legacy tool suite to start a React project. Most developers now use Vite."
