            "content": "At a **Senior or Lead level**, your value isn't just in writing hooks; it's in making decisions that affect dozens of developers and millions of users. You must understand the **trade-offs of the modern web**: when to use Server Components, how to scale state across micro-frontends, and how to maintain a world-class design system. This guide covers 50+ high-level questions designed for architects.",

            "title": "1. React Server Components (RSC) & Data Architecture",
            "content": "**Q1: Explain the RSC wire format.**\nUnlike HTML, RSCs send a serialized representation of the component tree to the client. This allows React to weave server-rendered parts with client-side state without losing user focus or scroll position.\n\n**Q2: The 'Request-Response' mental model shift.**\nIn the past, we fetched data *after* the component rendered. With RSC, data fetching is part of the rendering itself. How does this eliminate 'Waterfall' requests?\n\n**Q3: Sharing state between RSC and Client Components.**\nYou can't pass a function (like a state setter) from an RSC to a Client Component. How do you handle shared state? (Hint: Composition, URL params, or specialized providers).\n\n**Q4: Server Actions vs. API Routes.**\nWhy use Server Actions over traditional POST endpoints? Discuss standard security, 'Progressive Enhancement', and the reduction of boilerplate code.\n\n**Q5: Poisoning the Client Bundle.**\nUsing the `server-only` package to ensure sensitive logic or large libraries (like Prisma or heavy parsers) never leak into the client-side JavaScript."

            "content": "**Q6: Concurrent Rendering: Under the Hood.**\nHow does React use 'Time Slicing' to break down heavy re-renders? Discuss how it yields control back to the browser to prevent frame drops.\n\n**Q7: Selective Hydration.**\nExplain how `Suspense` allows React to start hydrating parts of the page before the entire bundle has even finished downloading.\n\n**Q8: Optimizing 'Initial Load' vs 'Interaction to Next Paint' (INP).**\nSeniors must balance TTI with interactivity. How do `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue` specifically target INP improvements?\n\n**Q9: Virtualization Strategies.**\nBeyond `react-window`, how do you handle variable-height items in a multi-thousand-row list without layout shifts?\n\n**Q10: Memory Management in Long-Running Apps.**\nIdentifying leaks in `useEffect` closures, global event listeners, and oversized caches in libraries like Apollo or TanStack Query."

Discuss the scalability issues of centralized state in micro-frontend environments.\n\n**Q12: Atomic State (Jotai/Recoil).**\nHow do atoms allow for highly granular re-renders compared to selector-based stores? When is this a performance win?\n\n**Q13: Finite State Machines (XState) in React.**\nWhen is a Reducer not enough? Discuss managing complex UI flows (like checkout or multi-step forms) using formal state machines to eliminate 'Impossible States'.\n\n**Q14: Context API vs. State Management Libraries.**\nExplain the 'Unnecessary Re-render' problem with Context and how to solve it without moving to an external library (e.g., splitting contexts or memoization).\n\n**Q15: Persistence and Hydration of Client State.**\nHandling state synchronization between LocalStorage, Cookies, and React State in a way that is secure and SSR-compatible."

Discuss peer dependencies vs internal bundling.\n\n**Q18: Testing in a Distributed Frontend.**\nHow do you run E2E tests when one team's change might break another team's app? Discuss 'Contract Testing' for the frontend.\n\n**Q19: CI/CD for Monorepos (Nx/Turbo).**\nExplain 'Computation Caching' and 'Affected Commands'. How do you ensure a 100-app monorepo has a sub-10-minute build time?\n\n**Q20: The Shell App Pattern.**\nDefining the responsibilities of the 'Host' app (Auth, Global Nav, Routing) vs the 'Remotes' (Features)."

Explain the philosophy of testing the 'User Experience Contract'.\n\n**Q23: Mocking at the Network Level (MSW).**\nWhy is mocking `fetch` manually a bad idea? Discuss why intercepting at the network layer is the standard for resilient tests.\n\n**Q24: Code Coverage: Vanity Metric vs Value.**\nHow much coverage is enough? Discuss the 'Pareto Principle' in testing and where to focus efforts (Business logic vs UI primitives).\n\n**Q25: Integration vs E2E.**\nWhere do you draw the line? When should a test be a fast Vitest integration test vs a slow Playwright E2E test?"
