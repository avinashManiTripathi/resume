            "content": "At a **Senior or Lead Level**, Angular engineering is about **scalability, stability, and organizational velocity**. You are responsible for systems that can be maintained by hundreds of developers over a decade. In 2026, the focus has shifted to **Zone-less Angular**, **Signal-based fine-grained reactivity**, and **Module Federation**. This guide covers 50+ high-level questions for the modern Angular architect.",

            "content": "**Q1: Why the move from Zone.js to Signals?**\nExplain how Zone.js's 'monkey-patching' approach impacts performance and bundle size. Discuss how Signals allow for 'Fine-grained' updates, potentially bypassing the need to check the entire component tree.\n\n**Q2: Signal-based Components (Signal Components).**\nHow do components behave differently when they rely entirely on Signals for input, output, and queries? Discuss the performance gains of 'local' change detection.\n\n**Q3: The `effect` and `computed` primitives.**\nExplain the dependency tracking mechanism of Signals. Why is it important to never 'write' to a signal inside an `effect`? Discuss 'Glitch-free' execution.\n\n**Q4: Interoperability: RxJS & Signals.**\nWhen should you use `toSignal` vs `toObservable`? Discuss the architectural decision of using Signals for UI state and RxJS for asynchronous event streams.\n\n**Q5: Pre-rendering and Hydration in 2026.**\nDiscuss 'Non-destructive Hydration' and how Angular 16+ prevents the 'flicker' during initial load. How does 'Zone-less' impact the hydration lifecycle?"

Discuss use cases in complex UI directives.\n\n**Q25: Tree-shakeable Providers.**\nWhy is `providedIn: 'root'` the industry standard?
