            "title": "1. The Warm-Up (Mock Phase)",
            "content": "**Q1: Walk me through your resume.**\nThis is your elevator pitch. In a mock interview setting, practice summarizing your experience in reverse chronological order. Highlight the skills and achievements most relevant to the 'target' job. Practice keeping this under two minutes. Focus on the 'why' behind your career moves, not just the 'what'. For example, explain why you moved from a developer role to a lead role—was it to mentor others? Was it to take on architectural challenges?\n\n**Q2: What is your preferred work environment?**\nPractice articulating what makes you productive. Do you thrive in open offices with lots of collaboration, or do you prefer quiet heads-down time? Do you like a structured corporate hierarchy or a flat startup structure? Be honest but flexible. In a mock session, get feedback on whether you sound too rigid or too vague. The ideal answer shows self-awareness and alignment with the company's culture.\n\n**Q3: How do you handle constructive feedback?**\nThis is a crucial soft skill. Describe a specific instance where a manager or peer gave you critical feedback. How did you react? Did you get defensive? Or did you listen, ask clarifying questions, and implement changes? Practice framing this story to show emotional maturity and a growth mindset. In a mock interview, your partner can actually give you feedback on your answer to test your real-time reaction!\n\n**Q4: Describe your ideal manager.**\nThis question tests cultural fit. Avoid saying 'someone who leaves me alone'. Instead, focus on positive traits like 'someone who provides clear goals but autonomy in execution', or 'a manager who is a mentor and supports professional development'. Practice explaining *why* this style works for you. This helps the interviewer understand how to best manage you if you were hired.\n\n**Q5: What are your hobbies outside of work?**\nWhile this seems casual, it's a 'culture fit' question. Practice sharing a hobby that shows dedication, creativity, or teamwork (e.g., sports, music, coding side projects). Avoid controversial topics. The goal is to show you are a well-rounded person. In a mock setting, observe if your answer sparks a natural conversation, which is a good sign of rapport building."

            "title": "2. Situational Challenges",
            "content": "**Q6: What would you do if you realized you couldn't meet a deadline?**\nThis tests integrity and communication. The 'right' answer involves early communication. Practice saying, 'As soon as I realized the timeline was at risk, I would assess the cause, estimate the delay, and immediately inform stakeholders with a proposed solution or alternative plan.' Practice delivering this answer with confidence rather than guilt. It shows proactive management.\n\n**Q7: How would you handle a conflict with a coworker?**\nSimulate a scenario where you disagree on a technical approach. Practice explaining how you would schedule a private meeting, listen to their perspective, explain yours with data, and seek a compromise. Focus on the resolution and the professional relationship. In a mock interview, have your partner push back to test your ability to stay calm and constructive.\n\n**Q8: Describe a time you demonstrated initiative.**\nEmployers want self-starters. Practice telling a STAR story about a time you saw a problem or opportunity that wasn't your direct responsibility and acted on it. maybe you automated a manual task or fixed a bug in legacy code. Practice highlighting the *impact* of your initiative (e.g., 'saved the team 10 hours a week').\n\n**Q9: How do you handle a heavy workload with competing priorities?**\nThis is about time management. Practice explaining your prioritization framework (e.g., impact vs. effort). Mention tools you use. Crucially, practice explaining how you communicate expectations when you can't do everything. 'I would speak to my manager to clarify which tasks are critical and re-negotiate deadlines for the others.'\n\n**Q10: What would you do if you saw a colleague doing something unethical?**\nThis is a potential 'trap' question. The answer depends on severity, but generally involves speaking to the person first (if minor) or escalating to HR/Management (if serious/legal). Practice navigating this carefully. Emphasize your commitment to improved integrity and company policy while avoiding sounding like a busybody."

            "title": "3. Technical & Problem Solving",
            "content": "**Q11: Explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical person.**\nThis tests communication skills. Pick a concept like 'API', 'Database', or 'Recursion'. Practice using analogies (e.g., 'An API is like a waiter in a restaurant...'). In a mock interview, ask your partner if they understood. If they look confused, try a different analogy. The goal is clarity, not jargon.\n\n**Q12: How do you stay updated with the latest technology trends?**\nPractice listing specific sources: blogs (e.g., Medium, Dev.to), newsletters, podcasts, or conferences. Mention specific technologies you are learning right now. This shows continuous learning. In a mock session, ensure your answer sounds genuine and not just a list of buzzwords.\n\n**Q13: Describe your process for debugging a difficult error.**\nDon't just say 'I use console.log'. Walk through a systematic process: reproducing the error, isolating the component, checking logs, hypothesizing causes, and testing fixes. Mention using debugging tools. Practice showing your logical thinking process. This reassures interviewers you won't get stuck.\n\n**Q14: What is your favorite programming language and why?**\nBe opinionated but open-minded. Practice explaining the *pros and cons*. 'I love Python for its readability and libraries, but I prefer C++ for performance-critical systems.' This shows you understand the trade-offs in engineering decisions, which is a senior-level trait.\n\n**Q15: How do you ensure code quality?**\nPractice discussing code reviews, linting, unit testing, and CI/CD pipelines. Mention that you value clean, maintainable code over 'clever' code. In a mock interview, this is a great chance to discuss your philosophy on software craftsmanship."

            "title": "4. Culture & Soft Skills",
            "content": "**Q16: What makes you a good team player?**\nDon't just say 'I'm friendly'. Give examples of supporting others, sharing knowledge, or covering for a teammate. Practice describing a specific team success and your role in it. Use inclusive language ('we' instead of 'I' when talking about team wins).\n\n**Q17: How do you handle boredom or repetitive tasks?**\nEvery job has them. Practice saying, 'I try to automate them if possible. If not, I focus on the value the task brings to the bigger picture, or I use the time to listen to educational podcasts if appropriate.' This shows a positive attitude and efficiency mindset.\n\n**Q18: What is your proudest professional achievement?**\nThis is your time to shine. Practice telling a story with high stakes and a great outcome. Quantify the results (e.g., 'increased revenue by 20%'). In a mock interview, check if your enthusiasm comes across. If you sound bored telling your own success story, the interviewer will be bored too.\n\n**Q19: How do you adapt to change?**\nChange is constant in tech. Practice describing a time a project scope changed or a tool was deprecated. Explain how you pivoted quickly and helped others adapt. Show that you view change as an opportunity, not a threat.\n\n**Q20: Provide an example of how you solved a problem in a unique way.**\nThis tests creativity. It doesn't have to be a technical problem. Maybe you reorganized a file system or changed a meeting format. Practice explaining the 'before' and 'after' to show your innovative thinking."

            "title": "5. The 'Do You Have Questions?' Phase",
            "content": "**Q21: Mock Question: Ask me about the team culture.**\nIn the mock session, *you* ask the interviewer. Practice phrasing meaningful questions like, 'How does the team celebrate wins?' or 'How do you handle failures?' This shows you care about the environment you will be working in.\n\n**Q22: Mock Question: Ask me about challenges.**\nPractice calculating a question like, 'What is the biggest technical debt specific challenge the team is facing right now?' This shows you are ready to help solve real problems from day one.\n\n**Q23: Mock Question: Ask me about professional development.**\n'Does the company have a budget for conferences or training?' This shows you are ambitious and want to grow with the company, which suggests retention value.\n\n**Q24: Mock Question: Ask me about the product roadmap.**\n'What features are you most excited about releasing in the next 6 months?' This demonstrates interest in the business side of the company, not just the code.\n\n**Q25: Mock Question: Ask about the next steps.**\n'What does the rest of the interview process look like?' This is a standard closing question. Practice asking it confidently. It shows you are organized and interested in moving forward."
